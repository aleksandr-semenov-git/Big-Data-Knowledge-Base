### Definition:
Cloud has several characteristics, let's speak about 'em deeply
1. **On-Demand Self-Service** – it means that there is no need of human interaction, everything can be automated just with a button. Any resource can be created just be a click on a button
2. **Broad Network Access** – simply, resources can be accessed everywhere using the network. As an example, resources from Azure's UK Data Center can be accessed by a user in Poland.
3. **Resource Pooling** – physical resources are shared between customers
4. **Rapid Elasticity** – resources can be scaled up and down, automatically
5. **Measured service** – payment just for resources that've been used
