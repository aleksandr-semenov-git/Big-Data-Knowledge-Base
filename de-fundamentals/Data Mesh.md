[[Contradictions Around Data Mesh]]
### Definition:
DM (Data Mesh) is an architectural framework that solves advanced data security challenges through distributed, decentralized ownership. Simply, it means that instead of a central data team owning all data, each domain team (e.g., sales, marketing, finance) owns, produces, and serves their own data as a product, using **shared standards**. There is a great image that shows comparison between classic centralized architecture and DM approach architectures
