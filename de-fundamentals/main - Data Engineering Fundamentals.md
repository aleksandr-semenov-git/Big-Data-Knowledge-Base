### Core Concepts in Data Engineering 
Data Engineering is a multifaceted discipline focused on designing, building, and maintaining the infrastructure and systems for collecting, storing, processing, and analyzing large volumes of data. It serves as the backbone for data science, analytics, and business intelligence initiatives. 
### Key Pillars of Data Engineering 
1. **Data Ingestion:** The process of collecting raw data from various sources. This can involve batch processing, real-time streaming, or a combination of both. 
	* Related concepts: APIs, Message Queues (e.g., [[AWS SQS]], [[AWS Kinesis]]), CDC (Change Data Capture). 
2. **Data Storage:** Designing and implementing robust and scalable storage solutions for different types of data. 
	* Related concepts: [[Data Lake]], [[Data Warehouse]], Data Marts, NoSQL databases (e.g., [[AWS DynamoDB]]), Relational Databases (e.g., [[AWS RDS]]), Object Storage (e.g., [[AWS S3]]). 
3. **Data Processing:** Transforming raw data into a clean, usable format for analysis and consumption. This is where [[ETL]] (Extract, Transform, Load) or [[ELT]] (Extract, Load, Transform) pipelines come into play. 
	* Related concepts: Spark, Flink, Hadoop, MapReduce, [[AWS Glue]], [[AWS EMR]]. 
4. **Data Orchestration & Workflows:** Automating and managing the execution of data pipelines to ensure timely and reliable data delivery. 
	* Related concepts: Apache Airflow, Prefect, Dagster, [[AWS Step Functions]]. 
5. **Data Governance & Quality:** Ensuring data reliability, security, compliance, and usability throughout its lifecycle. 
	* Related concepts: [[Data Governance]], Data Quality Frameworks, Metadata Management, Data Catalogs. 
6. **Data Delivery & Consumption:** Making processed data available to analysts, data scientists, and business users through various tools and interfaces. 
	* Related concepts: APIs, BI Tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI), Dashboards. 
### Evolving Paradigms in Data Engineering 
The field of Data Engineering is constantly evolving, with new architectural patterns and methodologies emerging to address the growing complexity and scale of data. Concepts like [[Data Mesh]] and Data Fabric are gaining prominence as alternative approaches to traditional centralized data platforms. Understanding these core concepts and their interconnections is fundamental for any Data Engineer building robust, scalable, and efficient data solutions. ##
