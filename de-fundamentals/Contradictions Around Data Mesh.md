### Contradictions around framework:
1. As we know, DM (Data Mesh) framework promises that each team treats their data like a product. So there is a **contradiction**: many teams donâ€™t have the time, skills, or incentive to build and maintain data products. For example, why would a sales team suddenly become great at data engineering?
2. DM is scales better in large organizations. There is a **contradiction** that in small or mid-size teams this approach will add complexity without ant benefits.
